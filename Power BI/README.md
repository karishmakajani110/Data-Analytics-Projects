# Data Professional Survey Dashboard (Power BI)

## Project Overview
This project analyzes survey responses from data professionals using Power BI. The objective was to clean, transform, and model the data to create an interactive dashboard that summarizes trends related to roles, skills, compensation ranges, geographic distribution, and job satisfaction.

The dataset contains responses from approximately 630 participants and was prepared for reporting and exploratory analysis.

## Objective
- Clean and prepare survey data for analysis  
- Analyze patterns related to roles, skills, salary ranges, and satisfaction  
- Build an interactive Power BI dashboard to summarize survey results  

---

## Tools & Technologies
- Power BI  
- Power Query  
- DAX  

---

## Data Source
A public survey dataset of data professionals was used for dashboard development and analysis.

---

## Data Cleaning & Transformation
The following steps were performed using Power Query:

- Removed empty and irrelevant columns  
- Grouped low-frequency categorical values into an "Others" category (e.g., job title, programming language, country, industry)  
- Cleaned and transformed salary range fields for aggregation  
- Validated data consistency prior to building the dashboard  

---

## Analysis Performed
The dashboard includes summaries and comparisons of:

- Average salary by job title  
- Programming language usage across roles  
- Geographic distribution of survey respondents  
- Work-life balance satisfaction  
- Salary satisfaction  
- Perceived difficulty of entering data-related roles  
- Average age of survey participants

## Dashboard Output
An interactive Power BI dashboard was developed to allow users to explore survey results using filters and visuals across roles, skills, geography, and satisfaction-related metrics.

---

## Outcome
This project demonstrates the use of Power BI for data cleaning, transformation, basic modeling, and dashboard development, with a focus on presenting survey data in a clear and structured format for reporting and exploration.
