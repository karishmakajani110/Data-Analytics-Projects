# COVID-19 Data Exploration using SQL

## Project Overview
This project explores global COVID-19 data using SQL to analyze infection rates, mortality trends, and vaccination coverage across countries and continents.

The analysis was conducted using Microsoft SQL Server (SSMS) on a public Kaggle dataset containing approximately 85,000 records.

## Tools & Technologies
- SQL (Microsoft SQL Server / SSMS)
- CTEs
- Temporary Tables
- Views
- Window Functions (PARTITION BY)

## Data Source
- Public COVID-19 dataset from Kaggle

## Data Preparation & Transformation
- Created CTEs to structure multi-step analytical queries
- Used temporary tables and views to store intermediate results for reuse and future visualization
- Applied window functions (PARTITION BY) for population-based and comparative analysis
- Performed aggregations and joins across multiple datasets

## Analysis Performed
- Total Cases vs Total Deaths
- Total Cases vs Population (infection percentage)
- Countries with Highest Infection Rate compared to Population
- Countries with Highest Death Count per Population
- Continents with Highest Death Count per Population
- Total Population vs Vaccinations

## Key Insight
The analysis showed significant variation in infection and death rates across countries and continents, highlighting how population size, infection spread, and vaccination coverage influence mortality trends.

## Outcome
This project demonstrates practical SQL skills for data exploration, trend analysis, and working with real-world public datasets.
