# Airbnb Data Analysis & Dashboard (Tableau)

## Project Overview
This project analyzes Airbnb listing data using Tableau to explore pricing, revenue, and listing distribution across neighborhoods and property attributes. The objective was to prepare the data, create calculated fields, and build an interactive dashboard that allows users to compare pricing and revenue patterns across locations and listing characteristics.

Public Airbnb data for Seattle was sourced from Kaggle and combined across multiple CSV files for analysis and visualization.
